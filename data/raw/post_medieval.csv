They were particularly common in the reign of William III (1694-1702). They are not uncommon finds but their significance is not understood. While 'love tokens' should be inscribed with the name of the person loved most of these defaced coins are uninscribed. Bending coins as part of an oath is an ancient practice but did not involve them being defaced. These coins may have been carried as good-luck charms but few of them are perforated for suspension, the usual way of wearing a charm. The writer has seen an account of silver coins being added to a churn to aid the forming of butter but has been unable to verify this. Certainly, the double fold would prevent it from sticking to the side of the churn.

Cook writes:Single coins do not normally qualify as Treasure, according to the terms of the Treasure Act of 1996. However, coins that have been converted into something else, usually for jewellery purposes, do have the potential to be considered as Treasure and there are many cases of this in the record. The gilding of a silver coin would have the consequence of enhancing its value above its intended level, if in each separate case to an uncertain degree, so it seems unlikely that a gilded coin such as this would function normally in currency.Gilded low-denomination silver coins of 15th-century England have been occasionally recorded. However, their purpose has not yet been definitely established. It seems a legitimate presumption that the gilding was applied to these coins to remove them from normal currency and give them a different status and role. This might have been to serve as some sort of offering piece or to convert them into a decorative item of some type, with a particular purpose for which their small size was an advantage. If this logic is accepted, such gilded coins would seem to fulfil the criteria of Treasure.Dr Barrie J.

Reverse: FLORENT CONCORDIA REGNA; crowned shield. IM: Blackamoor's head, (1626-1627). North no. 2148.The coin has been deliberately pierced in two places and therefore was submitted as potential Treasure resulting in the following report from Dr. Barrie J. Cook:I have examined a coin reported found at Irlam, Manchester. The coin is a gold unite (?1) of King Charles I, initial mark moor's head (issued 1626-7), wt: 8.83g. The coin is of the 'crown gold' standard, 22 carats fine, and thus over 90% gold. As a sum of money, it would probably have been equivalent to something like ?100 or more in modern terms. The coin is bent and crumpled in its current state, but this probably occurred after deposition.Single coins are not normally eligible for consideration as Treasure, but coins that have been converted into jewellery are so eligible. This coin has been pierced twice, with very large holes that appear to be aligned across the coin. One hole is 11mm from the edge and the other 9mm, so they are approximately, though not exactly, equally placed. The holes are fairly crudely made, as well as being large. At full weight the coin should have been around 9.1g. The piercing and loss of weight might suggest this coin has been removed from currency for some other purpose, though it is hard to suggest what that purpose might have been. An alternative explanation could be that the holes represent a defacing of the king's portrait during the Civil War, although there is no evidence that this was widespread (the Commonwealth regime made no attempt to remove older coin from currency in the 1650s) and reducing the value of a gold coin in particular would seem a strange thing to do. Nevertheless, it might still have been usable in currency at a discounted rate, because of its low weight.On balance, the evidence does not seem clear enough to justify a verdict of Treasure, according to the terms of the Act.Dr Barrie J.

Their total value of 4 guineas (i.e. ?4 4s.) was a considerable sum, equivalent to at least several hundred pounds in modern terms and up to several thousand, depending on the manner of comparison. Coin hoards from the mid-18th century are relatively rare, but there was an increase in hoarding from the 1790s to around 1812, the time of the wars with Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. There was large scale hoarding of gold in this period and the hoards that appear in modern times have usually consisted of gold guineas and their fractions. This find appears to fit well into this pattern.Conclusion: The Treasure Act 1996 states that any find that would have been classed as Treasure Trove is still defined as Treasure under the Act. Therefore this hoard of gold coins, which was probably deposited with the intention of recovery, should be considered as potential Treasure.",,,,,3,"George III of the United Kingdom",,,,,Modern,,,,,,,,,,,,2014-11-30T00:00:00Z,,Eastern,Cambridgeshire,Huntingdonshire,"Restricted access","Cambridgeshire County Area",,"Restricted access",,,,,"From a paper map","Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure",,504603,images/hfowler/,CAM1BA9BDCoinF.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Helen Fowler",CAM,2014-12-05T14:00:59Z,2017-09-05T11:37:38Z

It is a silver penny of King Charles I (1625-49) and will be of the sterling standard, over 90% fine metal. It is hard to date the coin more precisely, as it is folded over, almost into a flattened roll, with only the reverse visible and the initial mark hidden. It is likely to belong to the later 1630s or very early 1640s. Its weight is 0.49g.Single coins are not eligible for consideration as Treasure, unless they have been altered in some way to turn them into something else, usually jewellery. The alteration of this coin seems to have involved it being rolled and then threaded onto a piece of thread or other material.It is certainly the case that this coin has received an alteration, but it is not pierced or had any part of it removed, nor has it been gilded or otherwise ornamented. It is my opinion, therefore, that it remains essentially a usable coin and that therefore it does not clearly fulfil the criteria of Treasure, according to the terms of the Act.""Dr Barrie J.

Newark was besieged several times during the English Civil War (AD 1642 to AD 1651), and it surrendered on 6th May 1646.

In the 16th century the habit evolved of hanging a gold angel coin around the neck of the person touched by the king or queen and this became a firm part of the ceremony. After the Stuart Restoration no new angel coins were made and instead gold touch-pieces with elements of the angel design replaced them. They are almost invariably pierced, as this was part of their purpose. The gold used to make these medals was 22 carat fineness.As a gold medal with no monetary function, a touch-piece would fall within the purview of the Treasure Act and at least one has passed through the system in this way already.

This coin is copying a silver hammered 8 reales of Philip II of Spain (born 1527, reigned 1556-98) minted in Lima (Peru) between 1577 and 1588. Philip II of Spain was the husband of the British Queen, Mary Tudor (born 1516, reigned 1553-1558, married 1554-1558) who was the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. Philip II of Spain was also responsible for sending the Spanish Armarda to attack England in 1588. The mint mark is D for Lima. The full inscription would read: obverse: PHILLIPVS D G HISPANIA RVMET reverse: ETIN DIARVM REX. The coins minted in Lima were of poor strike quality and it is believed that many were officially melted down and remade when they reached Spain. The surface of this coin has an unusual look and the presence of a mould line around the flan edge confirms that it is a copy rather than a genuine coin. This copy is successful in the replication the 'smudged' effect over parts of the coin's surface that obscures the legend and image on both sides of the flan which could suggest that the mould for this copy was formed by being in direct contact with a genuine 8 reales coin of this reign.Dimensions: weight 22.78g, diameter 37.44mm, thickness is 2.12mm. Die axis is 6 o'clock. If this coin was not a copy the weight would be a little light for a genuine 8 reales coin but it is OK.A reference for this coin if it had been a genuine 8 reales would be: Clemente and Cayon nos. 3902-6.",,,,,3,,,,,,"English coin early Modern 1489 - 1660",,,6,,,,,,,,,,,Eastern,Cambridgeshire,,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder",,382976,images/hfowler/,CAM-E2AAC7.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Helen Fowler",CAM,2012-05-24T13:33:49Z,2012-05-29T15:16:00Z

It is a silver penny of King Charles I. It will therefore be of good silver, over 90% fine metal. The initial mark on the coin, which dates it, is not legible, but it was issued within the years c. 1632-4. Single coins are not normally eligible for consideration as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act, but coins removed from currency by conversion into jewellery or other decorative function are so eligible.  This coin has been pierced, fairly crudely, but in such a way that the king's head is upright, which suggests it had been turned into a small pendant, perhaps to indicate royalist sympathy during the English Civil War of the Commonwealth period that followed. However, while the conversion into a pendant is probable, it is also possible that the coin - relatively low in value, so the piercing might not have impacted on its potential monetary function so much - might have returned to currency use at a later stage.It is my opinion, therefore, that, on balance, the evidence does not support a clear case of Treasure, according to the terms of the Act.Dr Barrie J.

After subsequent subsoil removal two more silver coins were found within the fill of the ditch at its eastern edge. Reducing the fill of the ditch in 100-150mm spits and surveying each spit with a metal detector produced a further eight coins, also of silver, and a fragment of copper alloy. All eleven coins were recovered from a 3m x 2m area and were spot dated to the middle of the 16th century.DescriptionThe assemblage comprises of three groats, five sixpences and three shillings. The groats belong to the reign of Queen Mary I, 1553-1558. One is from the first year of her reign, 1553-1554 and other two are from the later part after her marriage to Philip of Spain, 1554-1558.The remaining eight coins, five sixpences and three shillings are from the first decade of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, 1558-1603 and date from 1560-1561 to 1568.The general condition of the assemblage is quite good with most coins showing some wear. One coin, SF 11 has been deliberately bent.The portraits on the obverses are worn but still visible, coins which the author has found in the past have been heavily worn or completely absent.DiscussionThe taphonomy of these coins with respect to their spatial disposition suggests that they are ex-situ. The horizontal spread of the assemblage was an area of 3m x 2m. Seven coins lay centrally in the ditch along a narrow corridor 1.80m long by 0.60m wide. They were vertically separated by a distance of approximately 45cm. The remaining four coins were located 1m away on the eastern edge of the ditch. The first coin found, SF1, sat in the subsoil/ditchifill horizon the other three coins were approximately 10-30cm below this level.ConclusionAlthough a provisional medieval spot date has been given for potsherds found in the lower ditch fill, they have not been shown to a pottery specialist at the time of writing. The assemblage, most likely held in a leather purse or other similar organic container, was probably deposited in a single event. After the container decayed coins entered the ditch in one of several ways; erosion, animal activity, root disturbance or the back-filling of the ditch with the change of land use.",,,,,3,"Mary I of England",,,,,"English coin early Modern 1489 - 1660",,,,,,,,,,,,2009-06-18T00:00:00Z,,Eastern,Suffolk,"Mid Suffolk","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Donated to museum by all parties, hence disclaimed as Treasure",,351149,images/jparol/,AN00790606_012.jpg,"Restricted info","Controlled archaeological investigation","Janina Parol",BM,2011-10-24T09:51:19Z,2011-10-24T09:59:00Z

The second coin is a shilling of first bust issue and dates from 1696.As the coins were clearly minted within a close period of time they would certainly have been in circulation as currency together and may well have been deposited or lost together at the same time, perhaps as a purse loss.

All are official English coins, one of gold and thus produced to the crown gold standard of 22 carats (i.e. just under 92% fine), and four of silver, struck to the sterling standard of 92.5% fine metal. Their details are as follows.Elizabeth I (1558-1603)Silver1. Sixpence initial mark coronet (1567-70) 1569 3.07g2. Sixpence initial mark crescent (1587-89/90) 1588 2.92g3.

Double-crown initial mark tower (1612-13) 4.99gThis group of coins could certainly have been in currency together in the reign of James I. It is the case that the coins of Elizabeth are of unusually good weight for a 17th century deposit, but it does seem, by virtue of the presence of a relatively valuable gold coin, that, though small, this is a group of good money. The machine-struck (milled) sixpence is, ironically the least well-preserved coin, but it is also the oldest there.Since these coins are all of good metal, would plausibly have been in currency together and are broadly in equivalent condition, it is highly likely that they represent a single deposit.

Cook:I have examined two coins found at Newton Bromswold, Northamptonshire. Both are English gold coins of the denomination of half-sovereign (= 10 shillings or half a pound). Both were also issued in the reign of King Edward VI (1547-53), despite the fact that the name and image on one of the coins is of his father Henry VIII. When Edward acceeded, his government had to consider how to deal with the debased coinage introduced by Henry in 1544 and, for a while, carried on in the style of the late king. The details of the coins are as follows:1. Half-sovereign, Edward VI in the name of Henry VIII, initial mark arrow (1547-9), Tower mint, wt: 6.17g2. Half-sovereign, Edward VI, Third Period, initial mark tun (1551-3), Tower mint, wt: 5.38gThe gold coinage was not progressively debased in the way that the silver was, so the older coin was still struck to a fineness of 20 carats (about 83% fine gold), and the later coin, though returning to 22 carats (about 92% fine gold), was lighter in weight, so both coins contained similar quantities of gold.",1,,"Gold coins do not commonly occur as single finds and it seems highly unlikely that two high-value gold coins from the same short period would have been lost separately on the same spot.

At 9.43g, it is well above the official weight for a shilling of 6g in the late 16th and 17th centuries: most shillings in regular use were significantly under 6g. As a result, it would not have survived in currency in its present state as a piece of money. The coin itself is quite worn, so it seems unlikely that the rim was there to act as a mount for jewellery purposes. The altered coin might have been intended to serve as a counter, since in some cases high-status sets of reckoning counters were made up by using numbers of actual silver coins in a silver cylinder or box - adding the rim might have both rendered the coins being used as distinctive and also made them better fitted to their container. Alternatively, the coin was altered to be set aside for use in a popular pastime, similar to shove-halfpenny, which is documented for the Tudor and Stuart periods - the utilisation of the broad and distinctive shillings of Edward VI in this game is specifically recorded. A very similar coin was reported in 2007, of the initial mark Y (1550-1), and similarly worn and with a rim, with a weight in that case of 7.11g.",,,"In this period the government of Edward VI had ceased to issue debased silver and restored the traditional sterling standard (92.5% fine metal) to its new issues.

As official coins of Elizabeth, they would be made from silver of the sterling standard, i.e. 92.5% fine metal. The finding of three coins of the same denomination in such close proximity allows a strong presumption that they were deposited together.

The coin has a flat band of silver, 1.65mm in depth, fitted around its circumference. This would have meant that the coin could not be used as tender; suggestions given for this have included that it was for use as a gaming counter including as a shuffleboard token or as a commemorative medal. The banding and coin have very similar discolouration patterns with some superficial black colouration. There are also some slight traces of orange brown coloration around the perimeter of the coin close to the banding - this is presumably due to whatever agent was employed in adhering the band to the coin.BM Report: ""I have examined a coin found at Towersey. It is a silver shilling of King Edward VI's Third Period (1550-3), initial mark Y (1550-1), from the London mint. In this period the government of Edward VI had ceased to issue debased silver and restored the traditional sterling standard (92.5% fine metal) to its new issues. As a result, coins of this issue were not affected by Elizabeth I's recoinage of the old debased money in 1560-1 and remained in currency long into the 17th century. Normally a single coin find is not eligible to be considered as Treasure. However, coins removed from currency and converted into items of jewellery are eligible thus to be considered and this coin appears to fall into a similar category. It has been augmented with a silver rim to permit it to fulfil some non-currency purpose and as a result it is significantly overweight: at 7.11g, it is well above the official weight for a shilling of 6g in the late 16th and 17th centuries: most shillings in regular use were significantly under 6g.",1,,"As a result, it would not have survived in currency in its present state as a piece of money. The coin itself is quite worn, so it seems unlikely that the rim was there to act as a mount for jewellery purposes. The altered coin might have been intended to serve as a counter, since in some cases high-status sets of reckoning counters were made up by using numbers of actual silver coins in a silver cylinder or box - adding the rim might have both rendered the coins being used as distinctive and also made them better fitted to their container. Alternatively, the coin was altered to be set aside for use in a popular pastime, similar to shove-halfpenny, which is documented for the Tudor and Stuart periods - the utilisation of the broad and distinctive shillings of Edward VI in this game is specifically recorded. To summarise: the coin found at Towersey is of good silver. It has been augmented to give it a non-coin function and, as a result, is analogous to an item of coin jewellery or a precious-metal medal or counter. If this proposal is accepted, the Towersey find would, in my opinion, fulfil the criteria of Treasure, according to the terms of the Act.Dr Barrie J.
