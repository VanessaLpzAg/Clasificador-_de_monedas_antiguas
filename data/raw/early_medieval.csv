Legend: 'ARVER' retrograde. Reverse: Schematic Victory advancing right holding wreath and globus cruciger (cross on globe). Legend: 'O+SOI', 'VR[S]IO' in exergue. The reverse also has a large glob of added gold over much of the central design, possibly from another coin. Likely intended to increase the weight of an underweight issue.Measurements: 12.86mm in diameter, 3mm thick with added blob (1.4mm thick without) 1.27g in weight.Discussion: Merovingian tremisses of the mint-and-moneyer type are relatively common as single finds in England, especially in Kent, and a single coin would not normally constitute Treasure. However, the coin has been modified by the addition of a blob of gold attached to the reverse. This brings it up to the normal weight of a tremissis of c. 1.3g, indicating that the original coin was significantly lighter than the correct weight. This item is one of a growing number of objects which indicate the existence of a gold bullion economy in the period, in which the tremissis was used as a unit of weight and a unit of account rather than the coins necessarily functioning as coins. Other examples are recorded of coins modified by the addition of extra pieces of gold, and a number of blank discs the same size and weight as tremisses have also been recorded, both in hoards and as single finds.There therefore seems to be no doubt that although this was originally a coin, it has been converted into an item of bullion, and there are numerous precedents for considering coins which have been converted into other types of object through secondary treatment as objects rather than coins for the purposes of Treasure. Under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996), a single object, unlike a single coin, potentially constitutes Treasure.Conclusion: The coin can be dated to the late 6th or more probably the 7th century. Although the metal content of this coin has not been analysed, coins of this period typically have a high gold content, with the remainder of the content primarily made up of silver. There is therefore no reason to doubt that the precious metal content is far in excess of 10%. In terms of its age and precious metal content, this object therefore constitutes Treasure according to the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996).",,,,,3,"Anonymous (Tremissis)",,Tremissis,,,"Coin of Merovingian Francia","Merovingian pseudo-imperial tremissis, uncertain type",,,,"Rosette diademed bust right, with detached lozenge diadem tie behind and detached rosette","Schematic Victory advancing right holding wreath and globus cruciger (cross on globe)","+ARVER (retrograde)","O+SOI', 'VR[S]IO' in exergue",,,,2018-05-14T00:00:00Z,,,Kent,Dover,"Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Submitted for consideration as Treasure",,1047262,images/ucljo/,KENT585A3A.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Walter (Jo) Ahmet",KENT,2018-08-16T15:09:39Z,2020-01-06T11:06:45Z

The reverse shows a beaded standard with Tufa containing a trefoil of pellets, and horns, with TOTII legend. A small part of the coin is missing, causing the loss of the first two letters of ""TIC"".The coin has been pierced by a single hole positioned on the neck of the bust and obliterating one ""I"" of the TOTII legend. The hole was pierced from the obverse, and is 1.1mm diameter. The coin is 11.9mm diameter, 1.7mm thick and 0.93g.According to Tony Abramson's 'Sceattas', p.6, distribution of these coins typically centred on the east and north-east of Kent and dated to the reign of Hlothere, AD. 673-685. Contemporary copies are known from the mouth of the Rhine and other parts of England which lacked their own coinage. At present it is not known if this coin is a genuine issue or a contemporary copy, but the findspot so far from the normal area of distribution may suggest it is a contemporary copy.Pierced sceattas are not common finds but a few others have been recorded by PAS.

Coin 3 [2017 T545] was found c.30 metres from the found spot recorded for 2016 T596. The rarity of these coins, alongside their closeness in date and stylistic links, makes it highly improbable that the coins were deposited independently of each other.

The obverse has a laureate bust right with a cross headed sceptre held before the face.

These were struck in the first half of the seventh century, the first coinage ever made in the town of York. Until recently their attribution to a mint in York was uncertain but recent finds, which show a clear Yorkshire focus, have made this attribution very likely. This find from near York would further strengthen this pattern. It would also be the first coin found so close to the mint since the 1840s discoveries of several shillings in the centre of York.The obverse depicts a standing facing figure, holding two crosses. The figure is more clear on earlier version of the shilling (groups D, A and B - see SWYOR-62B752) where the design is more clearly human. In type C, the design has become quite stylised. The blank is smaller than the die used to strike the coin meaning that elements of the design have disappeared from the edge.On the reverse there is a small cross within a beaded border, surrounded by a legend. This is struck off-centre, meaning that much of the reverse legend is obscured. The elements of the legend which can be read are:[ ] NOAP: [ ] (retrograde N).This legend follows the pattern of others within Group C, where the legends are difficult to interpret. Jon Mann suggested (Spink 25.iii.2015) that the legend on another Group C coin may have read SANCTE SAACTEF but this is not conclusive.The traditional dating of these coins is 640-60 AD. A date slightly earlier than this, contemporary with Crondall hoard coins, might be suggested given the alloy of these coins. Typically, this is c.60% gold. A date c.620-50 might be tentatively suggested.

AD 625-50), of Naylor and Allen variety D. North Vol 1, p.55, no.27. EMC number 2015.0127. The coin is 12.8mm diameter, 0.7mm thick and 0.73g. The obverse is worn, and there is a slight crack in the flan.Discussion: The coin is the same type as SWYOR-62B752 (EMC 2012.0025), and struck from the same pair of dies. The two coins were found around 400 metres apart in the same field, and are currently the only recorded examples of this variety within the York series, which is itself rare. It is extremely unlikely that the deposition of two coins so similar but also so rare in this proximity is coincidental. Theoretically, the two coins could either represent a dispersed hoard, or could represent a wider pattern of activity on the site. The latter would seem more likely if other finds of the same period had also been recorded from the site, but this appears not to be the case, suggesting that a hoard is more likely.Although the metal content of this example has not been analysed, those which have within the group, including the other Series D coin from the same site, all have a gold content in excess of 50%, with most of the remainder being silver.Conclusion: As a coin made of precious metal and more than 300 years old, it would appear to meet the requirements of the 1996 Treasure Act if it is part of a coin hoard. Given the association with another similar coin, it seems on balance that the two coins are more likely than not to come from the same dispersed hoard, and that this example as the second to be discovered is therefore Treasure.AuthorAmy Downes, South and West Yorkshire Finds Liaison OfficerGareth Williams, Curator of Early Medieval Coins, British Museum21.8.2017",1,"For inclusion in British Numismatic Journal ?Coin Register?",,,3,"Anonymous (Shilling/Thrymsa)",York,Thrymsa,,,"Early Anglo-Saxon gold coin","Sutherland V: York Group",,,,illegible,"cross with expanding arms in circle.

The coin is small, circular, 6mm in diameter and 3mm thick. The rim of the flan is irregularly-shaped, showing irregular panels caused by the initial casting of the flan or by secondary hammering. The obverse bears the motif of a double cross, formed of a single vertical strokes with two crossing bars or, if viewed at 90 degrees, like an H with a single horizontal stroke and two vertical bars. The tips of each bar are expanded to form a sub-triangular terminal. Around this central double-cross motif is a raised circular perimeter. The reverse is crude and 'granulated', and appears to be unstruck or struck from a poor die. This is a rare coin with just a few parallels from England, one of which comes from the same site as the present coin (PAS ref. LIN-58A436).A single example occurred in the famous Crondall hoard, the primary source of knowledge about the earliest English shillings usually ascribed to Kent or London, dating to 616-640, the reign following Aethelbert I. The Crondall example is given by Metcalf, Thrymsas and Sceattas Volume I, Plate 3, Item 73, together with two plain items of gold of the same size, from the same hoard, all weighing in the vicinity of 1.29-1.3 grams, as does the present example. Metcalf calls them 'Possibly Anglo-Saxon'. They may also be compared very closely with the example found at Sudbourne, Suffolk (PAS ref SF-F8EA61) and the example found near Coddenham, Suffolk, in association with a group of the (later) pale gold thrymsas including the hand and cross portrait type, the two emperors type, the Pada types and the Desaiona types. It is extraordinary that the two outstanding known group finds of thrymsas should both include an example of this rare type, despite the difference of their date horizons, but the fact leaves no doubt that the present object belongs firmly in a mid seventh century numismatic context.Another Nietap type tremissis from Lincolnshire is recorded on the EMC, ref: 2012.0120.",1,"Regional importance",,,3,"Anonymous (Tremissis)",,Tremissis,,,"Coin of Merovingian Francia","Nietap type",,,,"Line with two cross-bars, oval pellet at one end, within perimeter of ten pellets","Blank with indented surface - not die-struck",none,none,,,,2014-04-04T00:00:00Z,2015-04-11T00:00:00Z,"East Midlands",Lincolnshire,"North Kesteven","Restricted access","South Lincolnshire",,"Restricted access",,,,,"Generated from computer mapping software","Returned to finder",,516100,images/adaubney/,LIN0B3EEB.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Adam Daubney",LIN,2015-05-11T14:51:42Z,2016-03-21T16:01:24Z

Coroner:2014 -T880: A silver pierced coin or Sceat / Sceatta of Early Medieval dateHM Coroner: Mr Mark BricknellDistrict: HerefordshireDate: Early Medieval (AD 700 - 710)Findspot: Kington Area.Date of discovery: October 2014Circumstances of discovery: Whilst searching with a metal detectorDescription:A broken and pierced early-medieval silver sceat of Primary Phase Series C2. The coin dates to c.AD 700-710 and was probably minted in Kent. Approximately a quarter of the coin is missing, broken across what appears to be an old fracture roughly running along the hairline on the bust and through the piercing. The break itself, however, appears to be recent. The piercing suggests that the coin was used as a pendant or part of a necklace, and is located directly behind the bust at ear level on the obverse and directly above the standard on the reverse perhaps indicating that the reverse was intended to shown.Obverse: Right-facing crowned bust with square nose enclosing a pellet eye, a C-shaped ear with three pellets behind and a neck composed of two double pellet rows. There is a curving horizontal line below above three pellets, probably representing shoulders. In front a runic inscription, spelling ?pa, and behind the head an unbarred A with annulet beneath.Reverse: Pellet standard enclosing TOTII with a cross on each side and T (barely visible on flan) at each corner.Dimensions: diameter: 11.4 mm; width: 8.9 mm; thickness: 1.6 mm; weight: 1.0 g.Discussion:Finds of sceattas in Western Britain are rare but the type and findspot fit well into the known pattern of finds, albeit at its western edge (Naylor 2011). Pierced sceattas are very rare finds on a national scale. In recent years PAS have recorded a number of examples including Alvediston, Wiltshire (SOM-8325A1; 2012 T495), Barnby in the Willows, Nottinghamshire (DENO-808377; 2011 T424), West Horsely, Surrey (SUR-EF8F46) and Paulerspury, Northamptonshire (NARC-E843F2). A few examples are also known from late 7th- to early 8th-century Anglo-Saxon burials, such as two found in a grave at Wrotham, Kent (Rigold and Metcalf 1984: 267).Although single coins do not normally constitute Treasure this example has been modified through piercing and would have been worn as a pendant. This would have removed the coin from the circulating currency and changed its function. It should therefore be considered as an object rather than a coin, in accordance with a number of similar precedents.Coins of this type were produced of fine silver, well in excess of the 10% threshold set down by the Act and are over 300 years old. It is therefore my opinion that in terms of the key criteria of age and precious metal content, this find represents a clear case of Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).References:Brindle, T (2004) NARC-E843F2 An early medieval pierced sceatta from Paulerspury, Northamptonshire at: http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/70357Burrill, C (2011) DENO-808377 An early medieval pierced sceatta from Barnby in the Willows, Nottinghamshire at: http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/454952Burnett L. and Naylor J. 2012:SOM-8325A1 An early medieval pierced sceatta from Alvediston, Wiltshire at: http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/509420Naylor, J 2011, 'The circulation of sceattas in western England and Wales', Medieval Archaeology 55, 296-9.North J.J.: 1994: English Hammered Coinage; Volume I Early Anglo-Saxon to Henry III c.600-1272 Third Edition (2000) Spink: LondonRigold, S and Metcald D M 1984, 'A revised checklist of English finds of sceattas', in D Hill and D M Metcalf (eds), Sceattas in England and on the Continent, British Archaeological Reports British Series 128 (BAR, Oxford), 245-68.Williams, D (2006) An early medieval pierced sceatta from West Horsely, Surrey at: http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/127249AuthorsPeter ReavillFinds Liaison Officer, Portable Antiquities SchemeDr John NaylorNational Finds Advisor for medieval and post-medieval coinageHeberden Coin Room, Ashmolean Museum.

Discussion by Spink follows: The majority of surviving gold coins in the 9th century in Northern Europe are based on the gold Solidus struck by Louis the Pious c.816 which was copied extensively in the North Sea area. Most surviving examples of these come from three hoards found in the Netherlands. However a small group derive from the British Isles. This is the twelfth example of an imitation of the gold Solidus of Louis the Pious to have been found in Britain. Of these, seven (including this new example) are from locations within England. This new find is therefore a further indication that these imitations of the Louis the Pious Solidus were probably in use alongside other gold coins, such as the famous Coenwulf Mancus, and silver pennies struck by Anglo Saxon rulers in ninth century England. Within the English finds of imitation gold Solidi there is a cluster of three coins (Grierson Group XVI) which share the same dies, which have long been thought to have been produced in England. The find more recently of a lead trial piece for an imitation Solidus at Torksey adds further evidence for there being English produced imitations of the Louis the Pious Solidus. This new coin has similarities to those in the English cluster of three but the execution of the wreath, bust and inscriptions are in better style. With the only similar coin, Grierson Group III, in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris (with no find provenence and from different dies), the case for this coin being struck in England is less sure, but this does remain a distinct possibility.",,3,"Louis the Pious",,,,,,"English/Frisian copy of a gold solidus of Louis the Pious",,,,"Laureate, draped bust right with long vertical bar for nose, fine hairlines, inverted trefoil for eye","Suspended wreath containing a large cross patt?e linked to wreath on vertical axis",DNIIVVDOVSHMIAN,IVHVHVHISVNVN,NONE,,,2014-08-07T00:00:00Z,,,Lincolnshire,"West Lindsey","Restricted access","West Lindsey",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Returned to finder",,485011,images/dboughton/,FFSL9E265Da.png,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Dot Boughton",LANCUM,2014-09-17T20:35:01Z,2019-11-26T16:21:34Z

EMC 2012.0081.Discussion:Dr Lutz Ilisch comments: 'A rather typical specimen for a group of very crude imitative dirhams, which turn up characteristically in hoards of the very late 9th century and around 900. They have only one marginal ""legend"", generally transformed into tamgha-like signs, on both sides and a circle around the field on both sides. They are probably Khazar, but other origins in Eastern Europe and Northern Caucasia are possible. Typical examples are Stora Velinge I 2658, Klukowicze 920, Jena 1, 1420. Rispling calls them Group B2 and dates them to the second half of the 9th century.'The four piercings indicate secondary use as a decorative object, possibly as a brooch fitting.Dimensions: 26 mm diameter.As we have no evidence that this find was discovered post- 24 September 1997 we must evaluate it under Treasure Trove laws. Under Treasure Trove evidence would have to point to the object having been deliberately hidden with the intention of recovery.

The coin has been pierced and the remains of a separately cast cylindrical silver rivet are present towards one side of the flan, indicative of modification for usage as something other than a coin. Coins of this period were commonly either looped or pierced for suspension and worn as pendants, and it is likely that the purpose of the rivet was to secure a suspension loop. The coin has a very silvery appearance suggesting that the alloy has a low gold content, which is typical for the type. However, although coins of this type might conceivably fall below 10% of gold, the vast majority of the remainder of the alloy is typically silver, and although this particular example has not been tested, all comparable types tested have a precious metal content well in excess of 80%.Discussion: Three parallels to this coin are recorded on the EMC (1990.1285, 1998.0081 and 2010.0258) all with East Anglian distribution (see also Metcalf, 1993: pp. 47-49).

The coin is also recorded on the Early Medieval Coin Corpus, ref: EMC 2012.0128. Another Nietap type tremissis from Lincolnshire is recorded on the EMC, ref: 2012.0120, and another from the same site as the present coin is recorded as PAS ref. LIN-0B3EEB.The coin is small, circular, 8mm in diameter and 2.7mm thick. The rim of the flan is irregularly-shaped, showing bumps caused by the initial casting of the flan or by secondary hammering. The obverse bears the motif of a double cross, formed of a single vertical strokes with two crossing bars or, if viewed at 90 degrees, like an H with a single horizontal stroke and two vertical bars. Both tips of each bar are swollen into an irregular enlargement flat above but expanded at either side, somewhat like a heart-shape. Each stroke of the motif is approximately 4.2mm long suggesting that the die was formed by three strokes into the matrix each made with a single blow from the same cutting or impressing tool. Around this central double-cross motif is a ring formed by ten pellets spaced 1mm apart, linked by a connecting bar into a circle. The reverse is crude and 'granulated', and appears to be unstruck or struck from a poor die.This is a rare coin with just a few parallels from England. A single example occurred in the famous Crondall hoard, the primary source of knowledge about the earliest English shillings usually ascribed to Kent or London, dating to 616-640, the reign following AEthelbert I. The Crondall example is given by Metcalf, Thrymsas and Sceattas Volume I, Plate 3, Item 73, together with two plain items of gold of the same size, from the same hoard, all weighing in the vicinity of 1.29-1.3 grams, as does the present example. Metcalf calls them 'Possibly Anglo-Saxon'.They may also be compared very closely with the example found at Sudbourne, Suffolk (PAS ref SF-F8EA61) and the example found near Coddenham, Suffolk, in association with a group of the (later) pale gold thrymsas including the hand and cross portrait type, the two emperors type, the Pada types and the Desaiona types. It is extraordinary that the two outstanding known group finds of thrymsas should both include an example of this rare type, despite the difference of their date horizons, but the fact leaves no doubt that the present Sudbourne object belongs firmly in a mid seventh century numismatic context.",1,"Regional importance",,,3,"Anonymous (Tremissis)",,Tremissis,,,"Coin of Merovingian Francia","Merovingian tremissis",,,,"Line with two cross-bars, oval pellet at one end, within perimeter of ten pellets","Blank with indented surface - not die-struck.",,,,,,2012-03-01T00:00:00Z,,"East Midlands",Lincolnshire,"North Kesteven","Restricted access","South Lincolnshire",,"Restricted access",,,,,"From a paper map","Returned to finder",,376130,images/adaubney/,LIN2012-456.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Adam Daubney",LIN,2012-03-30T11:26:17Z,2015-05-11T15:01:01Z

The coin has been gilded, and pierced four times close to the edge, from the obverse to the reverse. On the obverse, the holes are arranged at 1, 5, 7 and 11 o'clock and three contain an iron rivet. The die axis is 12.The positioning of the holes suggests that this coin may have been attached to cloth or leather as a dress accessory to display the reverse cross. However, other coins of this type (and of the broader late Anglo-Saxon and early Norman period) are known to have been mounted as brooches/badges. There are various forms of pin attachment, amongst which are a hinged pin and catch-plate, each attached with two rivets. Although there appears to be no impression from such fittings, the similarity to other pieces makes this a likely interpretation. [i] Although a single coin would not normally constitute Treasure, there are numerous precedents of coins showing secondary treatment as ornaments as objects rather than coins, and therefore as potential Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).Obverse: Diademed bust left; in front, sceptre with a trefoil head+[E]DW[E]R D RE[Reverse: Short cross voided with expanding limbs joined at the base by two circles+[ ]LFPIN[E ] [O]N [PIL]TV:Moneyer: ?lfwineMint: WiltonDate: Early 1050sReference: North 823Dimensions and metal content: The object measures 19.69mm in diameter and weighs 1.89g (29.1 grains). Coins of this period routinely have a high silver content, far in excess of the 10% threshold stipulated by the Act. Although the presence of the iron rivets lowers the overall percentage of silver, they are too small to bring the total silver content below 10%, while the gilding enhances the precious metal content.Consequently, in terms of age and precious metal content, the object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act (1996).[i] Williams, G, 'Coin-brooches of Edward the Confessor and William I', BNJ 71 (2001), 60-70; Williams, G, 'More Anglo-Saxon and Norman coin-brooches', BNJ 76 (2006), 337-39.",1,"County / local importance",,,3,"Edward the Confessor","Wilton Castle",Penny,,,"Coin of the kings of All England 924/5-1066","N 823 (Expanding cross, heavy)",,12,,"Diademed bust left; in front, sceptre with a trefoil head","Short cross voided with expanding limbs joined at the base by two circles","+[E]DW[E]R D RE[","+[ ]LFPIN[E ] [O]N [PIL]TV:",,,,2012-01-27T00:00:00Z,,"South West",Wiltshire,Wiltshire,"Restricted access","Steeple Langford",,"Restricted access",,,,,"Generated from computer mapping software","Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure",,370144,images/khinds/,WILT-FE8512.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Katie Hinds",WILT,2012-02-06T14:48:49Z,2014-03-11T15:54:42Z

There is also a general resemblance to the obverses of other pennies produced by Tirwald (Chick 132-4) although none is an exact match, and so this coin is within the previous stylistic remits of the moneyer's other known coins.

Tirwald's attribution to Canterbury, whilst suspected, has remained uncertain but the evidence of this coin provides strong additional support for this proposed attribution.

RIC X no. 3759.Obverse: Diademed, draped bust right.Obverse inscription: [D N SEVERVS P F AVG]Reverse: Victory holding a crossReverse inscription: [VICTO]R[IA] AV[GGG]Die axis measurement: 6.00Dimensions: Diameter: 13.54mm; weight: 1.14g.Curator's report: A gold tremissis (? of a full gold piece known as a solidus) in the name of the Roman Emperor Severus III (AD 461-5). It shows his bust and has a reverse depicting Victory holding a cross, but is in a crude imitative style generally attributed from findspot evidence to the Visigothic Kingdom of Toulouse. It has been pierced nine times at intervals all along edge. Piercings at 3 and 9 o'clock (viewed from obverse) have broken at the edge. Presumably the number of holes was made in order to fix to a textile or leather backing.Metal content?At this period great efforts were made by the Romans and Byzantines to refine gold and silver for their coinage (they carried mint-markings guaranteeing the processes) and such coins were usually as pure as was then technologically possible (i.e. greater than 95%). Although late Roman legal writing implies a distrust of Gallic imitative gold coinage, modern scientific testing suggests a gold purity in the region of 80-90%.ConclusionA single coin would not normally qualify as treasure, but this piece has been modified into an appliqu? ornament, probably in England in the sixth or early seventh century, when coin-jewellery of this type was fashionable, and must therefore be considered as a single object, rather than a single coin, within the context of the Treasure Act (1996), and there is well-established legal precedent for this position.On the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that this artefact should constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being an item of precious metal jewellery of an antiquity greater than 300 years.Richard AbdyDept. of Coins and MedalsBritish Museum19.6.09",,,"Acquired by the British Museum",,3,"Anonymous (Visigothic)",,Tremissis,,,,"Gold coin of the Visigoths of France, not further defined",,6,,"Pearl-diad, dr & cuir r.","Crude figure of Victory standing left, holding long cross","D N S[...]ER-V(S)[...]F AV[...]",[...]R[...]-AAVG[...]G,-//[...]IIoB,,,2009-03-15T00:00:00Z,,,Kent,Dover,"Restricted access","Dover area",,"Restricted access",,,,,,"Acquired by museum after being declared Treasure","The British Museum",213922,images/fwinkley/,"Young - gold coin - June 09.jpg","Restricted info","Metal detector","Kate Sumnall",LON,2009-04-24T14:45:54Z,2019-11-11T15:56:17Z

A moneyer of this name is only known from Wilton at this period, and if this coin is from Wilton, which is likely, but not certain, then this represents a new mint for the Transitional Pyramids issue.  The mints known to have struck this transitional issue (North 835) are Cricklade, Dover, Droitwich, Sandwich, Tamworth, Worcester and Winchester, at none of which is there a recorded moneyer named ALFPOLD.  Mark Blackburn from the Fitzwilliam Museum and  EMC commented: ?I am pretty sure that the reading on this coin is +ALFPOLD[ ] but it could read +ALFPORD[ ]. If it is an R then that is quite a different moneyer, and it could then be a coin of the Worcester mint, where this Transitional type was struck by several moneyers.""  The attribution to Wilton cannot be settled firmly unless we find a die-link or another coin with the mint inscription, since Alfwold is not such a rare name that it could not appear suddenly at some other mint. However, there is one coin of Wilton of the regular Pyramids Type (which has an identical reverse design to the transitional variety), and that is in the British Museum (BMC 1362).  The London and Salisbury moneyers are known in middle issues of the reign (Small Flan at London and Trefoil Quadrilateral and Small Flan at Salisbury).

Both tips of each bar are swollen into an irregular enlargement flat above but expanded at either side, somewhat like a heart-shape. Each stroke of the motif is approximately 4.2mm long suggesting that the die was formed by three strokes into the matrix each made with a single blow from the same cutting or impressing tool. Around this central double-cross motif is a ring formed of a series of pellets spaced 1mm apart, linked by a connecting bar into a circle. As the strike is not central, part of the ring is missing, but as there are six pellets in the visible sector, which describes a full semicircle corresponding approximately with the arm-ends of the single stroke axis of the central motif, it appears that there were originally ten pellets thus linked to form the ring. The rim of the flan is irregularly-shaped, showing bumps caused by the initial casting of the flan or by secondary hammering.           This little coin is very unusual. A single example occurred in the famous Crondall hoard, the primary source of knowledge about the earliest English shillings usually ascribed to Kent or London, dating to 616-640, the reign following AEthelbert I. The Crondall example is given by Metcalf, Thrymsas and Sceattas Volume I, Plate 3, Item 73, together with two plain items of gold of the same size, from the same hoard, all weighing in the vicinity of 1.29-1.3 grams, as does the present Sudbourne example. Metcalf calls them 'Possibly Anglo-Saxon'. They may also be compared very closely with the example found near Coddenham, Suffolk, in association with a group of the (later) pale gold thrymsas including the hand and cross portrait type, the two emperors type, the Pada types and the Desaiona types. It is extraordinary that the two outstanding known group finds of thrymsas should both include an example of this rare type, despite the difference of their date horizons, but the fact leaves no doubt that the present Sudbourne object belongs firmly in a mid seventh century numismatic context, and reinforces its known distribution in south-eastern Suffolk.     Sudbourne falls closely within the region of intensive high-status activity in the 7th century associated with Rendlesham, Butley, Sutton Hoo, Iken (St Botolph) and Snape. Increasingly the view must be that this entire domain was in active use during the 'high' phase of Wuffing activity from Raedwald down to Ealdwulf (664-713) and AElfwald (713-749). Parts of Sudbourne are adjacent to the Butley river (between Deben and Alde) above Burrow Hill, a site increasingly active in the later seventh century. Sudbourne remained important during the period following the Viking Wars and the collapse of the East Anglian royal house, for during the 940s the entire estate of the 'Wicklaw', i.e. the area corresponding to the Five-and-a-half Hundreds purchased by Bishop Athelwold for the re-endowment of the monastery of Ely in 970, and therefore known as the 'Liberty of St Etheldreda', lay in the hands of a Danish Earl named Scule who was located at Sudbourne. (Liber Eliensis.) If (cf Peter Warner & co.) this endowment to Ely was a re-presentation of a franchise originally made to Etheldreda herself, foundress of Ely c.673, who had acquired the Isle of Ely by marriage, the presence of seventh century coinage in Sudbourne would be contemporary with the first phase of Ely activity there. The relationship of the type with examples found at Dorestad and Nietap (etc) illustrate important high-level contact with the Rhine communication before the period of the Utrecht mission. EMC 2004.0113",0,,"Dr Arent Pol of the Netherland Royal Collection adds the following remarks: 'I regard it as continental and would therefore call it a tremissis. This coin is of the same type as one of the Coddenham finds. In fact in recent years a few more specimens have turned up in Great Britain after the first one was found among the coins in the Crondall hoard (Sutherland 1948 p 91 nr 90a pl V.6): Coddenham, Hasland, Nettleton + one possibly English find auctioned by Classical Numismatic Group in 2001. All these small thick coins with very crude obverse ""designs"" derive from specimens struck with better preserved dies showing a head to the right (Belfort 5517, Prou 684). For my forthcoming catalogue I labelled the group ""Nietap type"" after the Dutch hoard with several specimens. Most of the coins of this type have been found on the continent:    Germany = Hemer    Netherlands = Bruchem, Nietap (9), Remmerden (3), Winsum, Wijk bij Duurstede, Wijnaldum    I tried to establish whether the Sudbourne coin is die-identical with or die-linked to any of the 27 coins with or without find provenance that I know, but unfortunately I have been unable to do so. Because of the non-design and the extremely small flan this is always a difficult (and     hazardous) exercise... The coin definitely belongs to a sub-group that shows a fineness of c. 60-70 % (75, 75, 58, 68, 71, 75 and 60, the latter ex Crondall). The stylistically slightly better coins do also have a slightly higher gold content (c.70-80%) and most of these were present in the Nietap hoard which is dated c.630/635: the Sudbourne coin     probably was struck not later than c.635/640.",,3,,,Thrymsa,,,,,,,,"Central six-armed cross with expanded arm ends, within a ring formed of ten pellets linked by narrow bars.","Blank with indented surface - not die-struck.",,,,,,2004-07-11T00:00:00Z,,Eastern,Suffolk,"Suffolk Coastal","Restricted access",,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Returned to finder","Purchased for Orford Museum with a grant provided by the National Art Collections Fund.",32522,images/tplunkett/,"SUE SF-F8EA61.jpg","Restricted info","Metal detector","Tom Plunkett",SF,2004-08-03T14:32:30Z,2011-02-24T12:19:48Z
