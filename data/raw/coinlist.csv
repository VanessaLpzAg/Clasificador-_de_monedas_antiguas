The reverse does appear to be of Severus Alexander and is probably taken from an as - RIC IV, p. 109, cf. 480. No dupondius is recorded for this issue so an obverse of another coin, a dupondius, was probably used for the obverse mould. The obverse looks like Severus Alexander, but could also be Elagabalus (AD 2318-222). The coin could have been produced at any time up until the middle of the third century.Note that the obverse portrait appears to have a large beard, more akin to the Antonine emperors. However, comparison with the other coin (BH-386FB5) shows that this is actually the result of a flaw in the mould.

This is a rare find for Britain, and dates from c. 250 - 150 BC. Commenting on another similar find (ESS-5BFC67, recorded as CCI 10.0843), Ian Leins, Curator for Iron Age Coins at the British Museum comments 'This is a particularly interesting coin - not British, and perhaps not even technically Iron Age. It either belongs to the earliest phase of copying the bronze coinage of Marseille in the Paris basin (cf. Delestree & Tache type DT 147) or more likely, given the weight, style and method of manufacture, a genuine late issue of Marseille. If so, it was struck as early as the late 3rd or first half of the 2nd century BC. (For the likely series, see C. Brenot & S. Scheers, Catalogue des Monnaies Massalietes et Monnaies Celtiques du Musee des Beaux-Arts de Lyon, Leuven (1996), p.35, series 7).The coin is slightly worn and corroded. The flan is sub-circular, has a casting flash around the rim and two opposing sprues.

Reverse shows Pax advancing left. This coin is probably a contemporary copy, a limesfalsum, although it is very worn. It appears to be from the same mould as another coin found in Hertfordshire (BH-386FB5) which is a also a copper-alloy dupondius. 'Mint of Rome', AD 228. The reverse does appear to be of Severus Alexander and is probably taken from an as - RIC IV, p. 109, cf. 480. No dupondius is recorded for this issue so an obverse of another coin, a dupondius, was probably used for the obverse mould. The obverse looks like Severus Alexander, but could also be Elagabalus (AD 2318-222). The coin could have been produced at any time up until the middle of the third century.Having two limesfalsa from such close proximity in one county does suggest they were made locally in Britain, not imported from the Continent as is commonly assumed.Measures 20.9mm in diameter, 2.5mm thick and 7.16g.",1,,,,3,"Severus Alexander",,Dupondius,,11,,,,,,"Radiate bust / head right.","Pax running left holding olive branch and sceptre",Illegible.,"Probably: [P M TR P VII COS II P P, S C]",,,,2006-04-22T00:00:00Z,,Eastern,Hertfordshire,"North Hertfordshire","Restricted access","North Hertfordshire",,"Restricted access",,,,,"GPS (from the finder)","Returned to finder","with finder",132474,images/dwatters/,"Roman coin 06 257 - 36.jpg","Restricted info","Metal detector","Donna Watters",BH,2007-03-03T14:46:19Z,2016-02-19T15:58:44Z
