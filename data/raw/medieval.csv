In practice, only the double patard established itself in currency, with a formal valuation equal to the silver groat, i.e. fourpence. (Although the fineness of the coin was below the level of sterling, the weight of the coin was higher than the groat.)

This coin appears to parallel Number 32b on page 88 of The Coinage of Scotland, Volume I, by Edward Burns.Phase B coins appear to have considerable variety. Burns 32b (fig 51b) is the only example so far identified with both matching obverse and reverse legends. The plates in Burns (Volume 3) are very unclear, butthe obverse design does appear to match this coin.The obverse legend (LE REI WILT) is also seen on LIN-6B5027, but the obverse design is different. It is also seen in a Baldwin's sale catalogue from 2013 available at http://www.baldwin.co.uk/media/cms/fixedpricelist/S2013/BALDWINS%20SUMMER%20FPL%202013%20-%2008%20-%20SCOTTISH%20and%20IRISH%20COINS.pdf, again, with a different obverse design.The reverse legend of HENRI LE RWS and the use of a W instead of a V is not seen on any coins already recorded on the PAS database, but is listed for Burns 32b.Burns does not attribute 32b to a mint but notes that only three mints are named on the Short Double Cross and Stars coins of William the Lion: Edinburgh, Roxburgh and Perth. Henri le Rus is only known to have minted at Perth from the coins naming mints, but many coins do not name mints.

It is possible that the coins could have been in currency together in the mid to late 14th century, but it is also possible that they could have been lost separately, up to half a century or so apart. It is my opinion, therefore, that the evidence is not sufficiently clear to justify them being declared Treasure, according to the terms of the 1996 Treasure Act.Dr Barrie J.

This particular example differs in that a cut halfpenny has been employed, resulting in only half of a ring; therefore, it is suggested that it was probably mounted within a setting, with the deliberate file marks acting as 'keying'.A single coin does not normally constitute Treasure; however, the deliberate removal of the central portion would have rendered this halfpenny redundant as a coin; this and the associated filing of the legend suggest a deliberate adaptation.

The figure of Christ is on the side designed to be seen.The soldini of early 16th century Venice were present in English currency in very large numbers. Known as 'galley-halfpence', they functioned as unofficial halfpenny substitutes, since official small change was in short supply. As English coin finds, such soldini are probably more common than the contemporary English issues of halfpennies. Their silver content was high - about 95% being the standard of the Venetian silver coinage. Despite their ubiquity, the English government opposed the use of soldini and launched a campaign to prohibit their import and chase them out of currency, with apparent success in the 1520s.There is doubt about when the coin was converted into an item of jewellery, since, in principle, this could have happened at any time between the 16th and 18th centuries, since there seem to be no parallels that permit a more precise dating of the ornamental addition. However, cautiously, it may seem likely that the conversion would have occurred reasonably close to the coin's period of English currency and could even have come about as a consequence of the official campaign against its use. Thus a date in the early decades of the 16th century would seem probable.Compare WMID-F4E937 (2007 T627) and SWYOR-6C8455.",1,"County / local importance","As the object is substantially of good silver and can be regarded as an item of jewellery, probably dating from the 16th century, it fulfills the criteria of Treasure according to the terms of the 1996 Act.",,3,"Agostino Barbarigo","Little Venice",Soldino,,,,"Venetian soldino of Agostino Barabrigo (type 8)",,12,,"(Doge as standard bearer of Venice kneeling left receiving banner of St Mark from the patron saint standing right) [Mainly obliterated by loop]","Standing figure of Christ with halo holding a cross right.","AV BAR [DVX] (SMV)","LAVS (TIBI) SOLI",,,,2012-09-01T00:00:00Z,2012-09-24T00:00:00Z,"Yorkshire and the Humber",York,York,"Restricted access",York,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Donated to museum after being declared Treasure","Yorkshire Museum / British Museum",422037,images/acooper/,2012_T877_soldino.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Amy Downes",SWYOR,2012-12-06T11:56:32Z,2014-12-03T10:24:35Z

Also, the Long Cross penny in this pair is in relatively good condition and it seems unlikely it has experienced over three decades of currency.

The coins were found on separate occasions between September 2008 and April 2009, but all were found within the same area of c. 20m?. All four coins are of the same type, the Two Sceptres type (BMC iv) of William I, and all were struck at the mint of Gloucester. Three of the coins (one of which survives as a fragment) were struck by the moneyer Leofwine, and all three of these were struck from the same dies. The fourth was struck by the moneyer Sigelac or Seolcwine (represented here as SILAC). Coins of this period are rare, and coins of the Gloucester mint particularly so, with only one example of this type previously recorded from the Gloucester mint, to the best of my knowledge. Given the proximity of the finds, and the similarity of the coins, there is no reasonable doubt that the coins were originally part of the same deposit, although they were not all found together. They should therefore be considered as a single find for Treasure purposes.As four associated coins, these represent potential Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996). Although the coins have not been analysed for silver content, sufficient analyses have been carried out on other coins of the period to be certain that the silver content of all four coins would be well over 10%. Taken together with the dating of the coins, the four coins represent in my opinion a prima facie case of Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).Gareth WilliamsCurator of Early Medieval CoinageThe British Museum26.5.2010Catalogue1.

The field has long been under plough, and has been detected on a number of occasions, but predominantly turns up Roman rather than early medieval material, and there is nothing to suggest that it was an active site in the 12th century. Although it would be unusual for a coin of William I still to be in circulation by the reign of Stephen, and it is unlikely that this coin is directly associated with the other two, coins of Stephen himself are sufficiently rare that, in the absence of other 12th-century activity, it seems more likely than not that the two coins were originally deposited together, perhaps as part of a small purse spill or hoard The coins have not been analysed, but coins of this period typically have a high silver content, far in excess of the 10% threshold required under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).

In addition, there are small notches seemingly cut from the sides in three places. These are reguarly spaced at approximately 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock, and 8 o'clock (on the obverse). At c.10 o'clock, opposite the most prominent notch is what appears to be a raised area. These modifications would seem too regular to be plough damage, and may represent alterations to the coin so that it could be mounted for use as a brooch, a relatively common practice at this time although there is no evidence that the reverse had been gilded.The evidence from coin would suggest that it has been deliberately modified for use as jewellery which would have taken it out of the circulation of currency, and as such the object would qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996.Diameter: 16.83mmThickness: 0.68mmWeight: 1.1 grams",,,,,3,"Edward I of England",Canterbury,Penny,,,"English coin Edwardian type 1279 - 1377","Edwardian class 10cf3 (N 1042/1-2)",,6,,"Crowned bust facing forwards.

Edward III, Second Coinage ('Star-marked' issue), halfpenny, London (1335-43). The obverse is worn. The reverse has the remains of a cross with pellets visible in one quarter. There is a star or sun mint mark visible on the reverse, with the letters 'CI' from the legend CIVITAS.Diameter: 14.50 mm Thickness: 0.51 mm Weight: 0.26 grams.Discussion: A single coin would not normally qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996). However, by gilding the surface of the coin it is likely that it was removed from its normal function as currency, and treated as an object, something with a decorative function such as a brooch or pendant. Treasure case 2009 T15 (ESS-6429D2) is an example of a complete gilded penny, with no obvious adaptations beyond gilding, which was declared as Treasure, being treated as an object - as an object, this coin fragment fulfils the criteria stipulated in the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of both age and precious metal content.Report by: Laura McLean Finds Liaison Officer, Essex                                Colchester & Ipswich Museum Service                          September 2011",,,,,3,"Edward III of England",London,Halfpenny,,,"English coin Edwardian type 1279 - 1377","Halfpenny: Edward III, 3rd 'florin' coinage, not further defined",,,,Worn,"Cross with three pellets",,,,,,2011-03-11T00:00:00Z,,Eastern,Essex,Chelmsford,"Restricted access","Pleshey CP",,"Restricted access",,,,,"GPS (from the finder)","Returned to finder after being disclaimed as Treasure",,344117,images/lmclean/,2011T218giltcoin.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Laura McLean",ESS,2011-04-04T11:44:54Z,2013-03-21T14:37:15Z

(Although the fineness of the coin was below the level of sterling, the weight of the coin was higher than the groat.) The currency of the double patard was reinforced by a series of English royal proclamations during the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII, but its role was terminated by the onset of the Great Debasement in 1544: in practice, there were probably few still in use by this date. However, in the late 15th century and first couple of decades of the 16th, double patards of Charles the Bold were a part of the English currency and feature regularly in hoards alongside English groats and are also recovered as single finds.

All but one are silver pennies of the kings of England and would thus have had a fineness of about 92% silver. The remaining coin is an issue of the English kings from Ireland, of the same standard. All but one of the English coins belong to the Short Cross coinage, in production between AD 1180 and 1247. The remaining coin is a penny of Edward I, issued in AD 1280-1. Between the issue of this coin and the others, there were two wholesale national re-coinages (in AD 1247 and 1279) and a weight reduction for the penny, so the penny of Edward I can safely be regarded as a coin lost separately and individually, and not part of the main group. The Irish coin is contemporary with the Short Cross coins and circulated in England.Of the 17 Short Cross coins, 15 are full pennies and 2 are cut half-pennies. The Short Cross coinage was issued across several reigns with a largely unchanging design, naming HENRICVS REX - King Henry: there is no English coinage in the names of Richard I and John. The reverse of each coin carries the name of the moneyer and mint responsible for its production.The group found at Wendover comprises mostly pennies of Class 7, with just 2 older pennies and one of the cut half-pennies being older. However, there is nothing later than mid Class 7b, which stopped being issued in c. AD 1232. Late Class 7b and Class 7c issues are not normally rare. The coins have some wear, and their average weight, 1.24g for the pennies, is below average. It seems, therefore, that we have here a group of coins extracted from currency on one occasion in the mid 1230s.It is my opinion, therefore, that 18 of the 19 coins found would constitute Treasure according to the terms of the Act.Dr Barrie J.

The coins were found about 6.0m apart in the ploughsoil and their locations recorded by the finders using a hand-held GPS device. The groat (the four-penny coin) was the highest value silver coin in production and functioned much as a ?20 or even ?50 note today. To find two of the same issue in close proximity, with similar degrees of usage, and with no other denominations present would be extremely unlikely as the result of two separate losses. A common deposit or loss is the more likely scenario.Dimensions: Metal content: The finds contains a minimum of 10% silver and predate 1700. They thus qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996 in terms of precious metal content, age and as representing two or more coins lost together.Frank Basford, Finds Liaison Officer, Isle of Wight, July 2009.",,3,"Edward III of England",London,Groat,,,"English coin Edwardian type 1279 - 1377","Groat: Edward III, 4th coinage, pre-treaty C (N 1147)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"South East","Isle of Wight","Isle of Wight","Restricted access",Shorwell,,"Restricted access",,,,,"GPS (from the finder)",,"Returned to finders, 19/10/2009",216900,images/fbasford/,"2009 T379 Mr Fitt.JPG","Restricted info","Metal detector","Frank Basford",IOW,2009-07-14T11:47:59Z,2010-05-27T14:45:31Z

The general description of the coin is as follows: Obv.: shield with the arms of Burgundy +KAROLVS DEI GRA DVX BVRG CO FLA . Rev. Cross fleuretty with diamond-shape at centre SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTVM. In 1469 a monetary convention between Duke Charles and King Edward IV made the former's coinage in the Low Countries legal tender in England. In practice, only the double patard established itself in currency, with a formal valuation equal to the silver groat, i.e. fourpence. (Although the fineness of the coin was below the level of sterling, the weight of the coin was higher than the groat.) The currency of the double patard was reinforced by a series of English royal proclamations during the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII, but its role was terminated by the onset of the Great Debasement in 1544: in practice, there were probably few still in use by this date. However, in the late 15th century and first couple of decades of the 16th, double patards of Charles the Bold were a part of the English currency and feature regularly in hoards alongside English groats and are also recovered as single finds.

All of the new finds are completely consistent with the original ones, which - since the hoard was so unusual - make it certain that they all form part of one single deposit. The highly unusual aspects of the earlier groups are all in evidence among the newer finds: the dominance of Shrewsbury mint coins, though lacking any of class 3c, and the same disproportionate representation of the four Shrewsbury moneyers (many of Ricard and few of Peris).",1,"National importance","All the new finds confirm the impression of the earlier finds, as described in my original report:'The hoard probably represents a core of material initially acquired straight from the Shrewsbury mint and exchange... That the find-spot of the hoard is so close to Shrewsbury itself, might suggest that this portion might well have remained in the possession of one original owner. New coins were subsequently added to the Baschurch hoard, either occasionally or else in one batch during the issues of class Vg.'If it is accepted that the new find forms part of an original single deposit, the bulk of which was included in my earlier report, then the conclusions of that report are applicable to this material. The Baschurch find as a whole, therefore, consists of coins of good silver that would have been in circulation together in the mid to late 1260s. The preponderance of Shrewsbury mint issues makes it essentially impossible that the coins represent anything other than a savings hoard of some kind, since it bears little similarity to the general currency of mid 13th century England. It is my opinion, therefore, that this latest find fulfils the criteria of Treasure according to the terms of the Act.Original Hoard Report:2007-T545PAS record number: HESH-A5B566Object type: COIN HOARDBroadperiod: MEDIEVALCounty of discovery: ShropshireStable url: http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/196485Addenda 1:2008-T774PAS record number: HESH-B81F84Object type: COIN HOARDBroadperiod: MEDIEVALCounty of discovery: ShropshireStable url: http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/431149Addenda 2:2009-T289PAS record number: HESH-4AA683Object type: CoinBroadperiod: MEDIEVALCounty of discovery: ShropshireStable url: http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/251501Addenda 3:2010-T613PAS record number: HESH-5B1A41Object type: COIN HOARDBroadperiod: MEDIEVALCounty of discovery: ShropshireStable url: http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/410421",,3,"Henry III of England",Shrewsbury,Penny,,,"English coin short and long cross period 1180 - 1278","Long cross class 3b (N 987)",,10,,"Crowned head facing.

AD1180-c.1189.Circumstance of DiscoveryA hoard of 34 coins reported found by metal detector in the North Carnforth area, Cumbria.DescriptionAll are silver pennies of the Short Cross type, in production 1180-1247, with just one cut halfpenny of the series: at this time the penny was the only coin in production and was physically cut into halves and quarters to make halfpennies and farthings. One of the pence comes from the distinctive Rhuddlan mint. A detailed list is attached to this report. As official English coins of the 12th and 13th century, all will be of good silver, over 90% fine in standard. The Short Cross coinage has been divided by modern scholars into 8 main groups, which can be dated. The Carnforth coins come from the early years of the coinage, between its introduction in 1180 under Henry II to within class 4 of the series - there are several coins of 4b but none of 4c, introduced in 1204. Later in 1204, there would begin a partial recoinage of the Short Cross issues, to remove underweight or clipped coin. It is highly likely, therefore that these coins represent a group removed from currency in about 1204. The coins are all of good silver and would have circulated together in the first few years of the 13th century.There is a lot of evidence to confirm that, within assemblages of individually-lost coins of the 13th century, cut fractions will normally dominate and coins will be present from across the range of the issue. Therefore, the narrow period of issue of most of this find and the preponderance of whole pennies all suggest that these coins represent one group (or part of a larger group), deposited on a single occasion in c. 1204.Class I (b or c); North 963 or 964.",,,,,3,"Henry II of England",London,Penny,,,"English coin short and long cross period 1180 - 1278","Short cross class 1, not further defined",,3,,"crowned bust facing, sceptre left","voided short-cross","hENRICV[S REX]","+PIERE[S ON LVND]",,,,2008-11-09T00:00:00Z,,"North West",Cumbria,"South Lakeland","Restricted access","North Carnforth",,"Restricted access",,,,,"From a paper map","Donated to museum after being declared Treasure",,316695,images/dboughton/,2008T69531-34.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Dot Boughton",LANCUM,2008-11-24T10:32:20Z,2011-02-24T13:47:38Z

All of the coins belong to the English Short Cross coinage, the coinage in production in the period 1180-1247. Their details are listed in a catalogue below. At this point the silver penny was the only coin made in England. As official silver pennies of the kings of England, these coins would be of the sterling standard, i.e. about 92.5% fine metal.The Short Cross coins were all struck carrying the name of King Henry (HENRICVS REX), i.e. Henry II, who introduced the type, although they continued to be produced through the reign of his sons Richard I and John and of his grandson Henry III until 1247, when they were replaced in a general recoinage. The Short Cross coinage has been subdivided into classes by modern scholars and it is usually possible to be more precise about any coin's issue period. All of the coins here were issued during class V, i.e. in the period 1204-c.1210, under King John, who instituted a partial recoinage in 1205 to remove clipped and poor quality coin from currency, although he did not change the general design.These coins do not appear to be significantly worn from use. This, plus the fact there are no coins from classes VI onwards, mean, therefore, that it is very likely that the Bigsby coins are very likely to represent a small group taken from currency together in about 1507-10. They would not be likely to represent a set of individually lost items, as these would normally be in very variable condition, would represent classes from throughout the Short Cross coinage and would also include cut halves and quarters, which are more common than whole pennies as individually-lost items.CatalogueDates of Class V subclasses:Va 1204-5Vb1 1205Vb2 1205-7Vb3 c.1206Vc c.1207-c.1210Class Mint Moneyer Reverse legend Weight 1.

Ten of the coins are English silver pennies of Kings Edward I (1272-1307) and Edward II (1307-1327); the remaining coin is a sterling issued by Arnold V, Count of Looz (1279-13). These, like other coins imitating English pence, are commonly found in English hoards of this period. The English coins will have a fineness of the established sterling standard, over 90% fine metal, and this type of sterling of Looz is also about 90% silver.The coinage of Edward I and Edward II forms one continuous series from the reform of 1279 and into the reign of Edward III. Two of the coins are from the mint of Berwick upon Tweed, which follows a different classification system. A detailed catalogue of the coins follows below, but the coins present range from class 4 (1282-9) to class 11 (late 1310 to c. 1314). The coins from Combs would certainly have been in circulation together in the first decade or two of the 14th century. The older coins present are relatively worn and light weight, with the more recent in a better condition. Although a relatively small group, the absence of later coins of the Edwardian types (classes 12 onwards) might suggest a deposit date of c. 1310-20).The coins from Combs include no lesser denominations, halfpennies and farthings, which had been added to the currency in 1279-80, indicating a degree of selection. The range present reflects the result of a partial recoinage which occurred in c.1300, so the classes present do not evenly represent output across the Edwardian series. It is my opinion, therefore, that this group of material would have been deposited together on one occasion, probably in the 1310s, and that it thus constitutes Treasure according to the terms of the Act.Catalogue:All coins are either pennies or foreign sterlings similar to the English pennyEdward I-Edward II Class 4 (1282-9) 4a or b London 1.08g (bent nearly double) 4b London 1.08g 4c London 1.29g (bent)Class 9 (c. 1299 to end 1300/early 1301) 9b1 York 1.31gClass 10cf (c. 1305-10) 10cf2(b) London 1.37g 10cf2(b?)

In 1469 a monetary convention between Duke Charles and King Edward IV made the former?s coinage in the Low Countries legal tender in England. In practice, only the double patard established itself in currency, with a formal valuation equal to the silver groat, i.e. fourpence. (Although the fineness of the coin was below the level of sterling, the weight of the coin was higher than the groat.) The currency of the double patard was reinforced by a series of English royal proclamations during the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII, but its role was terminated by the onset of the Great Debasement in 1544: in practice, there were probably few still in use by this date. However, in the late 15th century and first couple of decades of the 16th, double patards of Charles the Bold were a part of the English currency and feature regularly in hoards alongside English groats and are also recovered as single finds.

The Burgundian rulers were seen as friends of the English and this is the main reason that this type of foreign coin was allowed to circulate here.

They are both examples of the silver double patard (also known as the double plack) of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy (1467-1477), striking coins in his capacity as count of Flanders. The standards of this coin was a little over 80% fine silver. The general description of the coin is as follows: Obv.: shield with the arms of Burgundy +KAROLVS DEI GRA DVX B(VR)G COM FLA (for Flanders). Rev.: decorated cross with diamond-shape at centre SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTVM. They weight 2.89g and 2.72g. In 1469 a monetary convention between Duke Charles and King Edward IV made the former's coinage in the Low Countries legal tender in England. In practice, only the double patard established itself in currency, with a formal valuation equal to the silver groat, i.e. fourpence. (Although the fineness of the coin was below the level of sterling, the weight of the coin was higher than the groat.) The currency of the double patard was reinforced by a series of English royal proclamations during the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII, but its role was terminated by the onset of the Great Debasement in 1544: in practice, there were probably few still in use by this date. However, in the late 15th century and first couple of decades of the 16th, double patards of Charles the Bold were a part of the English currency and feature regularly in hoards alongside English groats and are also recovered as single finds. There have also been a few finds of small groups of double patards with no other coins. The two coins in question are good silver and would have been in currency together in England under the Yorkists and early Tudors. They are likely to represent a common deposit, since it seems improbable that two examples of the coin but none of the more common English issues, especially lesser denominations, would be lost separately in such close proximity.",,,"Therefore, there is a case for the coins constituting Treasure, under the terms of the Act.",,3,,,Uncertain,,,"Non English coin",,,,,"shield with the arms of Burgundy","decorated cross with diamond-shape at centre","+KAROLVS DEI GRA DVX B(VR)G COM FLA (for Flanders).","SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTVM.",,,,2007-11-23T00:00:00Z,,Eastern,Suffolk,Babergh,"Restricted access",Hitcham,,"Restricted access",,,,,"From finder","Returned to finder",,159192,images/fminter/,SF-EAC074.jpg,"Restricted info","Metal detector","Faye Minter",SF,2007-12-11T15:26:54Z,2011-07-26T16:09:16Z

The coins consist of 1 silver coin of Edward I (1272-1307 and 11 of Edward III (1327-77. As official coins of English monarchs of this period, they will have been struck to the traditional sterling standard, c. 92.5% fine metal. The latest coins present date to the period 1363-9. A detailed list is attached to this report.The find consists of 4 groats (the fourpenny coin), 2 halfgroats and 6 pennies: the silver denominations available in this period, except for lowest value halfpennies and farthings. The high-value gold coinage is not present. A detailed catalogue accompanies this report. The face value of the group in the mid 14th century was 2 shillings and 2 pence, a sum that might equate to something like ?20 in modern terms.The range and the condition of coins present is appropriate for the mid 14th century - many hoards demonstrate that pennies of Edward I and II continued to survive, reduced in weight by wear or clipping to the new weight standard introduced in 1351.The coins found at Kirkby Stephen would all have been in circulation together in the mid 14th century, and the condition of them is consistent with a single deposit, probably made in the later 1360s. It is noticeable that the most recent coins are from the northern mints of Durham and York, although these were beginning to take the lead in the production of pennies at this period anyway.CatalogueEdward I (1272-1307)1.

They remained in currency until the 1520s at least. In contemporary records they are known as ""double placks"" or ""Carolus placks"" (Pers. Comm. Barrie Cook, Department of Coins & Medals, The British Museum).""In hoards of 1464/5-1544 the most frequently encountered foreign silver coin is the double patard of the Duchy of Burgundy, which was accepted as an equivalent of the English groat in Anglo-Burgundian negotiations in 1469. ... hoards seem to indicate that double patards constituted at least 20 per cent of the groat currency by c.1500 (e.g. 22.9% in the Hounslow hoard). The contribution of the double patard to the groat currency seems to have declined slightly after 1500, as new supplies of English groats were produced, but they still constituted 14.7% of the coins of 4d. in the Hartford hoard and 15.4% in the Maidstone hoard"" (Allen, M. 2002.

The name 'Tealby' comes from the findspot of a massive hoard of these coins found in Lincolnshire in 1807. A great number of mints opened to undertake the re-coinage, many of which subsequently closed leaving less than half to continue producing coin of the later classes.A feature of this series is the poor quality of the struck coin, often using irregularly shaped flans and completely legible examples of any of the issues are rare. The series has been divided into 6 classes (A-F) based on variation of the bust and legend.The general appearance of the coin is thus:Obverse: Crowned facing bust of king with upper body armoured and visible to coins edge. Sceptre in right hand over right shoulder. Legend reads + HENRI REX A(NG) or variation thereof. Reverse: Legend reads +(Name of moneyer) ON (mint name) in a band around a cross potent.
